# Rubik's Cube Solver
This is the code for a Rubik's Cube Robot that I made with another student at UCI. The my-own-alg folder contains code that I created that models and solves the cube. I used a breadth-first approach on my solver. It solves a the cube using the CFOP Method. It takes about 90 seconds to run and solves in an average of 50 moves.

The efficient-solve folder contains code that is optimized. I created a UI using tkinter, and I used the twophase library to solve the cube in 21 moves or less in less than 0.5 seconds. Additionally, I set up the solver to output code that I copy into the arduino file. The Arduino file controls the motors in the robot, and solves the physical cube.

While, I did not model the physical robot, I assisted in design brainstorming, and I was in charge of the circuitry.
